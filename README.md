<h3> How to play </h3>The purpose of the game is to win. ðŸ˜€<br> You play here against a real pro, the Gina. <P>The goal of the game is to come closer to 21 points than your opponent, ideally to get exactly 21 points. But do not overdo it, because if a player passes 21 points, it is too much and he has lost. <p>Because the Gina plays so damn good, she has to turn a card over so that you can see it and estimate, if you already have enough points, or risk taking another card. <p>
If you get exactly 21 points, you win immediately, which is of course the best, because then the Gina does not come into play. <P>
Have fun playing!<p>
